![github](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/04c752c4-e6bb-46fa-b350-5ce22f10191e)


In this codelab, you’ll learn how to search for GitHub users by their username using JavaScript and GitHub’s API. You’ll create a simple interface where users can input a username, and JavaScript will make a request to the GitHub API to fetch user details such as profile information, repositories, and followers. The data will then be displayed on the webpage. This codelab teaches how to interact with APIs, process JSON data, and dynamically update the user interface. By the end, you'll have the skills to integrate API calls and build data-driven web applications.
